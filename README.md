# vuewp
Testrepo for Vuejs GraphQL

### More documentation will follow soon
This project is in a very early stage now. Intention is to create a decoupled front (vue) for a WordPress backend. JSON data is retrieved trough GraphQL instead of the REST API. I added the graphql endpoint here: [graphql-vuewp](https://github.com/whuysmans/vuewp-graphql).
